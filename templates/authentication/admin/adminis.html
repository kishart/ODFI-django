            Regional Directors (RD), Persons-In-Charge (PIC), or other
            individuals appointed by BBM, are required to identify potential new
            centers to be opened. Our aim is to have one Municipality Islamic
            Center (MIC) in every municipality in Cebu, and one Community
            Islamic Center (BCC) in every barangay in Cebu. There are about
            1,200 barangays in Cebu, which should make us very busy in the next
            few years.

            Once BBM has approved of the place, permits and approvals from the
            authorities and regulatory bodies (SEC, DSWD, barangay, etc.) must
            be acquired. Related aspects such as to rent or buy, to renovate, or
            to build the center will be duly discussed. The BCC can be a rented
            house of not more than 5k pesos/month or it can be an ODFI-owned
            building.

            same person or person(s) related by blood to each other or is/are
            each other’s spouse. There should also be at least one ustaz or

            Every MIC must have at least one van/ jeepney/ multicab and 2

            Every BCC must have at least one imam who is local. He is the
            caretaker of the BCC. He should already be living in the community
            not far from where the BCC is located. An operation budget of not
            more than 10,000 peso/month will be granted to the BCC, but the
            money is NOT to pay the imam. Rather, it is to be used for rental or
            to buy refreshments whenever there are classes held there, or to pay
            for utility bills, or other job-related expenses of the BCC. The
            imam does not get any salary as this is a voluntary position that he
            does just to attain Allah’s pleasure. The imam maintains his regular
            salaried job or whatever livelihood means he already has, and does
            his imam duties outside of his salaried/ current livelihood working
            hours.

            Every PIC should identify at least 3 local people to become imam at
            every BCC, and they should already have means of livelihood. All
            imams are encouraged to upgrade their knowledge of Islam
            continuously, and if they show potential, may be sent for more
            Islamic education that may lead to them becoming asatiz.
